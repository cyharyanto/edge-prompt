- What security validation must occur at each implementation stage?
- How can we balance security with educational flexibility?
- What security governance model ensures continuous alignment?

### Adaptable Implementation
- How should implementation adapt to varied educational contexts?
- What deployment flexibility is required for diverse environments?
- How can implementation phases accommodate resource variations?
- What feedback mechanisms should guide implementation evolution?

### Resource-Conscious Development
- How should development prioritize resource-constrained environments?
- What optimization considerations must guide each implementation stage?
- How can implementation validate effectiveness across device profiles?
- What baseline performance must be maintained throughout development?

## 2. Key Decision Points

### Architecture Evolution
- What architectural decisions must be made early vs. deferred?
- How should architecture evolve from prototype to production?
- What architectural validation should occur at each stage?
- How does architectural evolution maintain security boundaries?

### Educational Workflow Integration
- When and how should educational workflows be integrated?
- What teacher and student feedback should shape implementation?
- How can curriculum alignment be validated continuously?
- What educational stakeholders should be involved at each stage?

### Prompt Engineering Framework
- How should prompt templates evolve during implementation?
- What validation framework ensures template effectiveness?
- How can template management support educational flexibility?
- What template governance maintains safety boundaries?

### Edge Deployment Strategy
- What edge capability progression makes most sense?
- How should offline functionality be incrementally delivered?
- What synchronization mechanisms should be prioritized?
- How can deployment validate effectiveness in varied connectivity?

## 3. Priority Framework

### Impact Assessment Matrix
- **Educational Impact**: How directly does this enhance educational equity?
- **Technical Foundation**: Is this a foundation for other capabilities?
- **Resource Requirement**: What resources are needed for implementation?
- **Risk Level**: What risks does this implementation introduce?

### Capability Categorization
- **Core Capabilities**: Essential for minimum educational value
- **Enhancement Capabilities**: Significant educational enhancement
- **Optimization Capabilities**: Improve experience or performance
- **Future Capabilities**: Long-term educational innovation

### Implementation Sequencing Considerations
- Technical dependencies between capabilities
- Educational workflow integration points
- Risk mitigation sequencing
- Resource availability alignment

## 4. Validation Framework
