# EdgePrompt Guidelines: Introduction

## Purpose & Vision

The EdgePrompt Guidelines presented in this document serve as the definitive north star for our team's work. These principles articulate the foundational vision, core architectural approach, and philosophical underpinnings that must guide all aspects of the EdgePrompt project.

## How to Use These Guidelines

**For All Team Members:**
- Return to these guidelines regularly to ensure your work remains aligned with our core mission
- When faced with implementation decisions, consult these questions to guide your approach
- Use these principles to evaluate whether potential solutions truly advance our fundamental goals
- Reference specific sections when documenting technical decisions to maintain traceability to our guiding principles

**For Technical Implementation:**
- The documentation scaffolding provides practical structure for implementation, but all technical decisions must be validated against these guidelines
- When technical constraints create tension with these principles, elevate the discussion rather than compromising core values
- Security, educational equity, and universal applicability should never be sacrificed for technical expediency

## Relationship to Other Documents

- **Guidelines (This Document)**: The why and foundational principles - our north star
- **Implementation Scaffolding**: The how and practical structure - our roadmap
- **Technical Documentation**: The what and specific implementation - our execution

## Maintaining Fidelity to Our Vision

The ultimate success of EdgePrompt will be measured by its ability to bring AI-enhanced education to environments previously excluded due to resource constraints. Every line of code, every design decision, and every implementation choice should advance this mission.

The question-based format of these guidelines is intentional - it encourages continuous reflection and ensures we never lose sight of why we're building EdgePrompt. Let these questions guide your thinking, challenge your assumptions, and inspire innovative solutions that truly achieve our vision of universal, safe, and equitable AI-enhanced education.

# EdgePrompt: Universal Guardrails for AI-Enhanced Education in Resource-Constrained Environments

## 1. First Principles & Educational Equity

### Educational Equity as Universal Mission
- Why must AI-enhanced education be accessible regardless of connectivity, not just in well-resourced settings?
- How can structured prompting bridge educational disparities in any resource-constrained region globally?
- What fundamental educational rights does this framework protect, transcending specific regional contexts?

### Model-Agnostic Guardrail Philosophy
- Why will structured prompting remain essential regardless of future LLM capabilities?
- How does the neural-symbolic approach create enduring safety boundaries independent of model architecture?
- Why will the tension between model capability and safety constraints persist despite AI advancement?

### Teacher Empowerment Across Contexts
- How does EdgePrompt enable teachers globally to leverage AI without specialized technical expertise?
- What universal pedagogical principles guide the balance between safety and educational utility?
- Why must teacher autonomy remain central despite evolving AI capabilities?

## 2. Neural-Symbolic Framework Architecture

### Pattern-Based Safety Enforcement
- How do formal constraint patterns create transferable safety boundaries across different LLMs?
- What verification principles ensure consistent safety regardless of underlying model or language?
- Why will multi-stage validation remain necessary even as models become more capable?

### Universal Educational Workflows
- How does the framework support diverse curricula, languages, and educational systems?
- What core patterns of knowledge assessment transcend specific cultural contexts?
- Why must the system architecture accommodate educational diversity by design?

### Resource-Constrained Optimization
- How does the edge deployment strategy address universal challenges of limited connectivity?
- What performance optimization techniques apply across diverse hardware environments?
- Why will offline capability remain relevant despite infrastructure improvements?

## 3. Implementation Approach

### Future-Proof Design Principles
- How does the architecture anticipate continual evolution of AI capabilities?
- What abstraction layers insulate educational workflows from model-specific changes?
- Why will the separation of prompt engineering from educational interfaces remain essential?

### Cross-Cultural Safety Adaptability
- How do content safety boundaries adapt to diverse cultural and linguistic contexts?
- What mechanisms enable appropriate localization without compromising core safety?
- Why must safety verification respect educational norms across different regions?

### Universal Deployment Strategy
- How does the system scale across different educational environments and infrastructure constraints?
- What implementation patterns enable adaptation to varied regional requirements?
- Why does starting with regional pilots strengthen rather than limit the framework's universal application?

## 4. Scientific Contribution & Educational Innovation

### Novel Educational AI Safety Paradigm
- How does EdgePrompt advance the field of educational AI safety beyond current approaches?
- What unique contribution does structured prompting make to safe AI deployment in education?
- Why does the neural-symbolic approach offer advantages over pure symbolic or neural methods?

### Bridging Educational Technology Divides
- How does this framework specifically address longstanding inequities in educational technology?
- What mechanisms ensure technology serves pedagogy rather than constraining it?
- Why does this approach offer a more sustainable path to AI integration than alternatives?

### Adaptable Educational Assessment
- How does multi-stage validation enhance rather than replace teacher assessment?
- What educational measurement principles guide the automated feedback systems?
- Why will this approach remain pedagogically sound across evolving educational paradigms?

## 5. Technical Architecture & Implementation

### Enduring Security Model
- How does prompt constraint enforcement create model-agnostic safety boundaries?
- What validation principles will remain essential regardless of future model capabilities?
- Why must security boundaries evolve alongside but remain independent from model architecture?

### Educational Workflow Components
- How do teacher and student interfaces universally support diverse educational contexts?
- What assessment patterns remain consistent across different curricula and languages?
- Why must educational workflows dictate technical implementation, not the reverse?

### Resource-Adaptive Implementation
- How does the architecture scale from minimal to advanced infrastructure environments?
- What graceful degradation ensures educational continuity across varying resource constraints?
- Why does prioritizing resource efficiency strengthen rather than compromise educational impact?
